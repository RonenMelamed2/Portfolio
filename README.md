### 1.Birder 
A bird recordings prediction & labeling

Main features:
* Analyze long audio files segment by segment, with chosen overlap.
* Display a labeled segment in time with left and right markers, and a text label.
* Using a pre-loaded Tensorflow model, run inference on the current segment and display prediction results.
* Upload a custom Tensorflow model and specify relevant model and preprocessing parameters.
* Display top prediction probabilities using a bar graph.
* Run prediction sequentially on long wave files, and produce a prediction report for each segment.
* Add or erase borders, as well as shift existing predicted boders interactivly using the mouse.
* Edit predicted labels using the keyboard.
* Easily select time and frequency range using the mouse, and play audio with/without bandpass.
* Import time-signatures from text files.
* Export wave files/time-signatures report by hand tagged/predicted/imported timestamps.
